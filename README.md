###Django Code for Persona

Persona is a social networking site for creators and their creations.  It's designed to allow an author to create a fully fleshed out story, including characters, locations, artifacts and story arcs and to clearly define the relationships between them.
It's also designed to facilitate the development of these stories as a community.  This could be a group of gamers who are engaging in the shared creation of a world together, or friends collaborating on a movie script who want to map out their storyline together.
        Persona does this by allowing characters in stories to enage each other in fictional dialogues or communiques.
### How do I start?
  Everything in Persona starts with a story.     
  You can browse the public stories available on the site through the buttons to the right.
  If you want to start creating your own stories or to create characers, locations or items in an existing story, you'll need to register using the button to the top right.
  After registering and logging in, a story's creator can grant you access to their content or you can jump right in and create your own story!
  
### Code Base:
  Personas is coded in Python 3.4 using Django 1.7.  Several apps have been added, with key map functionality coming from Django-Leaflet.
  
### Plans:
  Persona is a pet project to teach myself web development and to create a fun, useful way for gamers, authors and creators to come together to discuss and build better worlds.  My plans are to tighten up the initial release, deploy the app, test and refine with a small group of gamers and friends, and then conduct an open release.  Hope to see you there.
